        Approach:
            - Treat each word as a node in a graph.
            - An edge exists between two words if they differ by exactly one character.
            - Use BFS to find the shortest path from beginWord to endWord.
            - Preprocess the word list into a mapping of wildcard patterns like h*t, ho*, etc. to reduce neighbor lookup time.

        Why it fits:
            - Minimum transformations in unweighted graph â†’ BFS guarantees the shortest path.
            - Generic wildcard mapping efficiently finds neighboring words.

        Invariant:
            - Each BFS level corresponds to one transformation.
            - All intermediate transformations must exist in wordList.

        Correctness:
            - The BFS terminates on the first discovery of endWord, giving the minimum sequence length.

        Complexity:
            - Time: O(N * M^2), where N = len(wordList), M = length of each word (max 10)
            - Space: O(N * M) for the graph + visited set
