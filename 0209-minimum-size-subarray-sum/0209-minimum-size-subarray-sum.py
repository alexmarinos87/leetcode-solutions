        Approach: Expand right to grow sum; while sum >= target, shrink left and record best length.
        Why it fits: Positives make the window sum monotoneâ€”expanding increases, shrinking decreases.
        Invariants: left <= right; total = sum(nums[left:right+1]); best is minimal length seen so far.
        Correctness: Every valid window is examined and shrunk to minimal size before moving on.
        Complexity: Time O(n), Space O(1).
