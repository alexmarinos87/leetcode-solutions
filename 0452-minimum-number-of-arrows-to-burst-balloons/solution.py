        Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons (LeetCode 452)

        Approach
        --------
        Greedy by earliest end (O(n log n)):
        - Sort intervals by xend ascending.
        - Shoot one arrow at the end of the first interval.
        - For each next interval [s, e], if s > current_arrow_x, it can't be
          burst by the current arrow â†’ shoot a new arrow at e and update current.
          Otherwise, it's already covered.

        Parameters
        ----------
        points : List[List[int]]
            Each element is [xstart, xend], xstart < xend.

        Returns
        -------
        int
            Minimum number of vertical arrows needed to burst all balloons.
