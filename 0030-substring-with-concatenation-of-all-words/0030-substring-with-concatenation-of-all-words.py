        Substring with Concatenation of All Words (LeetCode 30)

        Approach
        --------
        Fixed-size sliding windows by word offset (O(n)):
        - Let L be the common word length and M be len(words); each valid window has total length T = L*M.
        - Build a frequency map `need` of the words.
        - For each start offset in [0..L-1], slide a window in steps of L:
          * Add the next L-length chunk; if itâ€™s not in `need`, reset the window.
          * If a word count exceeds `need`, shrink from the left by one word at a time.
          * When the window holds exactly M words with valid counts, record the left index,
            then slide by removing one word from the left to keep searching overlaps.
        - Works efficiently because we never revisit characters except via L disjoint passes.

        Parameters
        ----------
        s : str
            The input string to search within.
        words : List[str]
            List of words (all the same length).

        Returns
        -------
        List[int]
            Starting indices of all substrings that are a concatenation of every word exactly once,
            in any order. May be returned in any order.
